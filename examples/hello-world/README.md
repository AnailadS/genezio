# Hello World example

In this example, we have a class with two functions that returns a welcome message.

The class is implemented in the `hello.js` file.

To deploy and test it run `genezio deploy`. Once the command was successfully executed you can run `node test-hello-sdk.js`.

To test the code locally open two terminals: in one run the `genezio local` command and in the other run `node test-hello-sdk.js`. Make sure you change the environment to `local`: `Remote.env = Env.Local`.
